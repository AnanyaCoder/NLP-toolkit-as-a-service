### Project Overview:
Due to the inherent nature of the field of NLP, any application development or research projects, involves trying out multiple algorithms / models. Trying out these algorithms can involve lots of work, and if everybody is doing it, it is lot of double work. And, if someone is low on compute resources, it restricts a programmer from exploring those models or algorithms.

To address this problem, our team set out on developing a platform which enables users to share and acess this knowledge within an institution and across teams.

### Components:
- [Frontend](frontend/):
  - for hosting details regarding all the services available.
  - for developers to try a particular service
  - A place to gather details of the APIs that developer can hit to access these services, if he/she intends to use these services in their application.
  - Allows developers to publish their applications/services.

- Individual services:
  - developed and published by developers.
  - individual services are run and hosted by the individuals. the frontend doesn't involve hosting a service.
  - Following services have been implemented and integrated with frontend by our Team
    - [Tokenization](Tokenizer/)
    - [Text Representations](TextEmbeddings/)
    - [Named Entity Recongniation](NER/)
    - [Sentiment Analysis](Sentiment Analysis/)
    - [Summarization](Summarization/)
    - [Machine Translation](MT/)
    Please access these individual pages for more details on each of these pages.
